# ATM Interface

A simple **Java-based ATM Interface** created as part of my **virtual internship project**.  
This program simulates an ATM where users can **check balance, deposit money, and withdraw money** with proper validation and interactive console messages.


## Features

- **Check Balance** – View your current account balance  
- **Deposit Money** – Securely add money to your account  
- **Withdraw Money** – Withdraw money with **insufficient balance checks**  
- **Interactive Menu** with user-friendly options  
- **Input Validation** to prevent invalid amounts or negative transactions  
- **Modular Code** with separate `BankAccount` and `ATM` classes
